# CSRv_ECMP-ASAv_HA-CSRv_ECMP
This folder contains example configuration to help you create day-o VNF files, and create VNFD and NSD deployments. 
You can download the zipped folder containing all the files required for deploying an end-to-end service chain made up of CSRs as bothâ€“the consumer and the provider side endpoint gateways; and connects them through two ASAv VNFs: one as active and the other as a stand-by VNF. A single network service descriptor (NSD) is created for the entire service chain and consists of four CSRv VNFs and and two ASAv VNFs.
Make sure you replace all variable values with values specific to your environment and configuration.
