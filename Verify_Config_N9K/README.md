Before proceeding with creating an SAE site using the inventory discovery method, it is important to complete the following steps.

Step 1: Verify that the status of LLDP neighbors is UP by running the command "show lldp neighbors". For an example output of the "show lldp neighbors" command, see the file LLDP_neighbors in this folder.

Step 2: See your VPC configuration by running the command "show vpc". For an example output of the "show vpc" command, see the file VPC_config in this folder.
